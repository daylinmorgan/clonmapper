ClonMapper was developed by Aziz Al'Khafaji in the [Brock Lab](https://brocklab.com)
at the University of Texas at Austin.

This protocol was originally published in [*Methods in Molecular Biology*](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-1811-0_8)
and exists here as a living protocol updated with the Brock Lab's current best practices.

If it is useful to you, please consider [citing](citation.md) the published protocol.

Submit any questions/issues you have with the protocol [here](https://github.com/brocklab/clonmapper/issues).
